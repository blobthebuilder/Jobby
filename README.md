# Jobby
Jobby is a full MERN stack application that can share small tasks and odd jobs within a community for others to complete. If you need help changing a tire, post a job on Jobby to get quick and easy help!

In addition to the full stack, I used Google Maps API and geocoding to provide localization of jobs.
